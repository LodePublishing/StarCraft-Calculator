TODO

- Change the 'gizmo' text :)

- Maybe change stats[3][60] to stats[180]

- Accept parameters like "Command Center" instead of "CommandCenter", too.

- SEGMENTATION FAULT: if the parameter is too long => recheck size calculation

- Optimize the program for speed

- CORE: Maybe cut a run in two runs with each 50 players

- Recheck colors

- LINUX: user inputs during calculation disturb screen

- IMPORTANT: allow cancel of calculation (kbhit or something like that)

- Allow max times in the parameter goals / file

- Insert a parameter that sets settings.txt to standard values

- Insert in mineral and gas calculation for minerals/geysirs that are nearly empty

- Rename Produce in Enqueue

- Rename Ziel in Buildable 

- Insert a tertiaer fitness: 'good readable build order' (more connected orders, "scv scv depot" instead of "scv depot scv")

- Recheck morph units (archon, guards etc.)

- Insert additional check whether the goals are possible at all (especially low times in the goal_?.txt files...)

- reorganize classes (constructors etc.)

- replace '60' with the max buildings constant

- make some 'name significant' variables :)

- check unsigned char <> unsigned short

- Recheck Linux/DOS Compatibility (1310 <> 10) (next line)

- Improve implementation of parameter checking and file input. Looks really hacked.

- Recognize block moves (for color output to stress changes due to mutations)

- Test and implement better algorithms for reproduction

- Recheck whole code for pointers / arrays

- Recheck the unit speeds in zerg.cpp, terra.cpp and protoss.cpp

- Implement location of buildings (expansion, wallin, ...)

- Maybe implement a 'start' build order and change the probabilites for mutations depending on existing orders (for example researchs need to be only once in the build order...)

- Check settings.txt for too many numbers.

- Maybe change the order in the 'switch / case' commands to improve the speed 

- Recheck Lair, Hive availible/force

- Implement acceleration of units during the run (for example zergling is already on its way and metabolic boost is researched)


You see, many little things for 1.03 to do :)
