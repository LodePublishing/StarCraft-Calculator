Readme for StarCraft Calculator v1.02:
--------------------------------------

Note: This is just a VERY SMALL readme with the most basic things.
You will find most informations on the 'StarCalc' page on www.clawsoftware.de.

1. What does this program?
	It calculates and optimizes build order.

2. How can I start the program?
	Read the 'INSTALL' file with any text editor.

3. How can I configure the program?
	Read and change the 'settings.txt'.

4. How can I change the goals?
	Read and change the 'goal_t.txt', 'goal_p.txt' or 'goal_z.txt'

5. What are the parameters of the program?
	Just run 'scc' without any parameters.

6. How can I cancel the calculation?
	Unfortunately only with "CTRL+C"

7. Ok, the program did calculate something and quit. Where is the output?
	Just look at 'bo_t.txt', 'bo_p.txt' or 'bo_z.txt' depending on the race.

8. Anything else?
	USE FULLSCREEN MODE! (ALT+ENTER in windows)

9. Hey! This program does not run and/or has bugs! What now?
	In this case please write an email to 'ghoul@clawsoftware.de' with a "BUG" in the subject line.

10. I do not know how to use this program :[
	Did you read all documentation? If yes: Write me an email, post in the forum or chat with me (remember www.clawsoftware.de ;)

11. I have another question which is not listed here...
	PLEASE WRITE ME! I have no idea what questions someone have who did not wrote the program personally :P


Oh, a last thing to start:

The goal_t.txt, goal_z.txt and goal_p.txt include 3 sample goal-configurations:
- Wraith rush
- Speed Zergling rush
- Reaver drop with speed shuttles and early defense (3 zealots after 5 minutes)

For a first test, just start scc and choose your race :)
Remember to adapt the goals/settings to your own needs (settings.txt and goal_?.txt).

For additional informations, updates, faq and general help, look at www.clawsoftware.de.

Most important: I need feedback!

Please send your suggestions/bug reports/questions etc. to:
