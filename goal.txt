Max Time 30 //in minutes, well... with a smaller number it will be faster at the beginning of the calculation... well... (btw: thirty is maximum)
Max Generations 3 //well, this is *failsave* i.e. five hundred generations per running
// Well... you can break up the running any time you want... It's just for those people (like me) who want to activate the program once and let them run until it really has a optimal build order
Max Vespene 1  // Standard map, but well, try more if you want *bghsux* ;-)
Mutations 25 // half of max length is fine... well there is always a better setting than the standard :P
Mutation Rate 50 // = max length should be fine, too... adapt it to your needs :P (btw: the greater the number the less mutations)

// As you know, zero to three are the possibilities for upgrades, just like in your favorite computer game ;-)
// In this section you should not type in numbers greater than one... ever tried to research burrowing two times? The program won't do any better than you :P

// You should enter goals the program will need to fullfill the task... read the readme.txt for more information
